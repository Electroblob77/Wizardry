This license applies only to the source code and assets present in this repository. The compiled mod (available at https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/electroblobs-wizardry) comes under its own separate license, see the aforementioned webpage for details.

TL;DR: Do what you want with this repo on Github, but ask me first if you want to put it anywhere else or publish your version. Don't try and make money off the repo or anything in it. I'm not responsible if the code breaks things, and if you help me out by submitting a PR, I can use and modify the contents of that PR as long as I give you credit.
