				"To the untrained eye, the magical runes with which spells are written are unreadable. In order to identify a spell, you could, of course, cast it and see what happens - though doing so may cause unwanted side-effects, and many spells need certain conditions in order to work. Futhermore, there is always a chance of misreading an unknown spell when casting, with potentially dangerous consequences depending on how powerful the spell is. A safer and more reliable option is to use a scroll of identification, which can be found in chests or purchased from a wizard. Right-clicking whilst holding one will identify the first unknown spell book or scroll on your hotbar, consuming the scroll of identification in the process."

				"#colour_advancedAdvanced #colour_resetwands are quite rare and are much more powerful. They can cast all spells except master spells, and hold #advanced_max_charge mana. Advanced spells can grant superhuman powers such as invisibility and wreak havoc on foes.",

				"#colour_masterMaster #colour_resetwands are the most powerful wands in existence. They hold up to #master_max_charge mana, and can cast any spell. Master spell books are very rare and the spells can cause complete devastation not only to enemies but even the world itself. Use with caution.",

				"To be upgraded to a higher tier, a wand must first become powerful enough to channel spells of that tier. Wands gain power as spells are cast with them. Spell variety, spell power, elemental effects and other external factors may all have an effect on how quickly a wand matures.",

				"Once a wand is sufficiently powerful, a tome of arcana provides the final catalyst needed to elevate the wand to the next tier (see @upgrading_wands Upgrading Wands@), and once this has happened, the maturing process can begin again for the next tier."

				"@spells Spells@ belong to different elements, which determine the nature of the spell and also grant perks when used with certain @wands@.",

				"#image elements",

				"#colour_fireFire#colour_reset \nPerhaps the most destructive element, fire concerns burning, lava, and explosions. A powerful pyromancer will unleash hell upon their enemies and probably set the world alight in the process. Most fire attack spells set fire to their target, causing ongoing damage over time. However, be wary that fire spells may have no effect on nether mobs.",

				"#colour_iceIce#colour_reset \nThe element of ice is made of all that is cold. Frost spells often slow enemies down or freeze them completely, and are especially effective on creatures of fire. Frost magic can prove equally useful outside of combat, such as freezing water to cross a river.",

				"#colour_lightningLightning#colour_reset \nThis element concerns lightning, storms, and the weather. A powerful storm mage is a force to be reckoned with, and some posess the ability to call down lightning at will. Lightning spells often damage multiple enemies at once and usually seek their target, making them an effective attack against any mob... but beware of creepers.",

				"#colour_necromancyNecromancy#colour_reset \nNecromancy is the element of darkness, chaos and the undead. Necromancers are mysterious and often regarded as evil, though this is usually not the case. Necromancy spells are commonly used to summon @creatures@ to fight for you or even bend the will of your enemies.",

				"#colour_earthEarth#colour_reset \nThe element of earth is focused on the natural world: animals, plants, the wind, and such like. Earth magic is diverse and takes a wide variety of forms, from poisoning enemies to unleashing the fury of the weather. Earth spells are a mixture of attack, defense and utility.",

				"#colour_sorcerySorcery#colour_reset \nSorcery is the element of force and change. Sorcerers manipulate light, gravity and even reality itself to fit their needs. Sorcery spells can be used, among other things, to grant their caster magical powers or move objects to their will.",

				"#colour_healingHealing#colour_reset \nThe element of healing is concerned with defense and regeneration. Healers seek to protect themselves and their allies as much as possible and as such can be very difficult opponents. Though generally not used as an attack, the purifying light of some healing spells will do considerable damage to the undead. Healing spells are indispensable when in combat.",

				"The boundaries between the different elements are not always distinct, and some spells bear traits of elements other than their own.",

				"If you are lucky, you may happen upon an elemental crystal. Elemental crystals are magic crystals that have absorbed elemental properties as they have grown - though the exact conditions required and mechanism by which this happens remain a mystery. We do know, however, that such crystals may be used to create elemental wands, which allow spells of the right element to be cast with more potency than usual."
