/**
 * Generic spell class which is the superclass to all spells in wizardry. When extending this class, you must do
 * the following:
 * <p>
 * - Have a constructor which passes all necessary constants into the super constructor. I define the constants here
 * so that the constructor for an individual spell has no parameters, but you may prefer to pass in the parameters when
 * the spell is registered, so all the mana costs etc. are in one place like a sort of sandbox.
 * <p> 
 * - Implement the {@link Spell#cast(World, EntityPlayer, EnumHand, int, SpellModifiers)} method, in which you should
 * execute the code that makes the spell work, and return true or false depending on whether the spell succeeded and
 * therefore whether mana should be used up.
 * <p>
 * - Register the spell using {@link RegistryEvent.Register}, with {@link Spell} as the type parameter. Each spell
 * should have a single instance, like blocks and items.
 * <i>As of Wizardry 2.1, spells use the Forge registry system. Related methods such as {@link Spell#id()} and
 * {@link Spell#get(int)} have been re-routed to use this system, leaving minimal external changes. Note also that
 * the constructor automatically sets the registry name for you, though you may change it afterwards if necessary.</i>
 * <p>
 * Also note that you can override some other methods from this class. For example, to add a
 * specific kind of formatting to a spell name or description, you can override {@link Spell#getDisplayName()},
 * {@link Spell#getDisplayNameWithFormatting()} or {@link Spell#getDescription()} and append the formatting code (though
 * you will have to call super() to get the name itself, since the unlocalised name is private). See
 * {@link SummonShadowWraith#getDescription()} for an example.
 * <hr>
 * This class is also home to some useful static methods for interacting with the spell registry:<p>
 * {@link Spell#get(int)} gets a spell instance from its integer id, which corresponds to the metadata of its spell book.<br>
 * {@link Spell#get(String)} gets a spell instance from its unlocalised name.<br>
 * {@link Spell#getSpells(Predicate)} returns a list of spell instances the match the given {@link Predicate}.<br>
 * {@link Spell#getTotalSpellCount()} returns the total number of registered spells.
 * <hr>
 * Spell implements the {@link Comparable} interface, and as such, any collection of spells can be sorted. Spells are
 * sorted by increasing tier (see {@link Tier}), from novice to master. Within each tier, spells are sorted by element,
 * the order of which is as defined in {@link Element} (i.e. magic, fire, ice, lightning, necromancy, earth, sorcery, healing).
 * <hr>
 * @since Wizardry 1.0
 * @see electroblob.wizardry.item.ItemSpellBook ItemSpellBook
 * @see electroblob.wizardry.item.ItemScroll ItemScroll
 * @see Spells
