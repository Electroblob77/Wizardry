/**
 * Generic superclass for all spells which use a raytrace to do something and (optionally) spawn particles along that
 * trajectory. This is for both continuous ('stream') spells and non-continuous ('bolt') spells. This allows all the
 * relevant code to be centralised. This class differs from most other spell superclasses in that it is abstract and as
 * such must be subclassed to define what the spell actually does. This is because ray-like spells do a wider variety of
 * different things, so it does not make sense to define more specific functions in this class since they would be
 * redundant in the majority of cases.
 * <p></p>
 * <i>N.B. The three abstract methods in this class have a {@link Nullable} caster parameter (the caster is null when
 * the spell is cast by a dispenser). When implementing these methods, be sure to check whether the  caster is
 * {@code null} and deal with it appropriately.</i>
 * <p></p>
 * Properties added by this type of spell: {@link Spell#RANGE}
 * <p></p>
 * By default, this type of spell can be cast by NPCs. {@link Spell#canBeCastBy(EntityLiving, boolean)}
 * <p></p>
 * By default, this type of spell can be cast by dispensers. {@link Spell#canBeCastBy(TileEntityDispenser)}
 * <p></p>
 * By default, this type of spell requires a packet to be sent. {@link Spell#requiresPacket()}
