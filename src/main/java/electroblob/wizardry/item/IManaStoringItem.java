/**
 * Interface for any items that store mana. This interface simply specifies methods for setting and getting the amount
 * of mana held in the item (plus a few convenience methods); implementations may differ between items.
 * <p></p>
 * In wizardry itself, mana is still implemented as durability, however, as of wizardry 4.2, the vanilla method
 * {@code Item.setDamage()} has been overridden to do nothing. Instead, mana must be interacted with using the methods
 * in this interface. This means operating via the item rather than the stack.
 * <p></p>
 * This change prevents general item repair methods working on mana items (see issues #66 and #153), and also allows
 * other items to implement mana differently if they wish. For example, a weapon that can cast spells as an ability
 * might want regular durability in addition to mana, so the mana might be stored in NBT instead. Items that do not use
 * durability to represent mana may need to do zero-checking themselves, as appropriate.
 * <p></p>
 * <i>Wizardry's items implement mana as the <b>inverse</b> of item damage; i.e. the <b>more damaged</b> the item, the
 * <b>less mana</b> it has. Beware of this when converting to the new system.</i>
 * <p></p>
