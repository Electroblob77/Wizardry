	 * Performs a ray trace for blocks and entities, starting at the given origin and finishing at the given endpoint.

	 * however, in this specific case it is more efficient to use

	 * @param world The world in which to perform the ray trace.
	 * @param origin A vector representing the coordinates of the start point of the ray trace.
	 * @param endpoint A vector representing the coordinates of the finish point of the ray trace.
	 * @param aimAssist In addition to direct hits, the ray trace will also hit entities that are up to this distance
	 * from its path. For a normal ray trace, this should be 0. Values greater than 0 will give an 'aim assist' effect.
	 * @param hitLiquids True to return hits on the surfaces of liquids, false to ignore liquid blocks as if they were
	 * not there. {@code ignoreUncollidables} must be set to false for this setting to have an effect.
	 * @param ignoreUncollidables Whether blocks with no collisions should be ignored

	 *                               for example, you want to replace snow layers or tall grass)
	 * @param entityType The class of entities to include; all other entities will be ignored.

	 * player that is performing the ray trace.
	 *
	 * @return A {@link RayTraceResult} representing the object that was hit, which may be an entity, a block or
