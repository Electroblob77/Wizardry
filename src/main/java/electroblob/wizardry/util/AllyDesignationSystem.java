	/**
	 * Returns whether the given target can be attacked by the given attacker. It is up to the caller of this method to
	 * work out what this means; it doesn't necessarily mean the target is completely immune (for example, revenge
	 * targeting might reasonably bypass this). This method is intended for use where the damage is indirect and/or
	 * unavoidable; direct attacks should not check this method. Currently this means the following situations check
	 * this method:
	 * <p></p>
	 * - AI targeting for summoned creatures<br>
	 * - AI targeting for mind-controlled creatures<br>
	 * - Constructs with an area of effect<br>
	 * - Instantaneous spells with an area of effect around the caster (e.g. forest's curse, thunderstorm)<br>
	 * - Any lightning chaining effects<br>
	 * - Any projectiles which seek targets
	 * <p></p>
	 * Also note that the friendly fire option is dealt with in the event handler. This method acts as a sort of wrapper
	 * for all the AllyDesignationSystem stuff in {@link WizardData}; more details about the ally designation system can be found there.
	 *
	 * @param attacker The entity that cast the spell originally
	 * @param target The entity being attacked
	 *
	 * @return False under any of the following circumstances, true otherwise:
	 *         <p></p>
	 *         - The target is null
	 *         <p></p>
	 *         - The target is the attacker (this isn't as stupid as it sounds - anything with an AoE might cause this
	 *         to be true, as can summoned creatures)
	 *         <p></p>
	 *         - The target and the attacker are both players and the target is an ally of the attacker (but the
	 *         attacker need not be an ally of the target)
	 *         <p></p>
	 *         - The target is a creature that was summoned/controlled by the attacker or by an ally of the attacker.
	 *         <p></p>
	 *         - The target is a creature that was tamed by the attacker or by an ally of the attacker
	 *         (see {@link net.minecraft.entity.IEntityOwnable}).
	 *         <p></p>
	 *         <i>As of wizardry 4.1.2, this method now returns <b>true</b> instead of false if the attacker is null. This
	 *         is because in the vast majority of cases, it makes more sense this way: if a construct has no caster, it
	 *         should affect all entities; if a minion has no caster it should target all entities; etc.</i>
